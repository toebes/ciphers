                            The timer app
                            on an iPhone or Android Phone that has a stopwatch function with lap function is sufficient.

                        <li>Encourage them to write their team number on all the other pages AFTER they begin the test.

                        <li>Teams can have up to two incorrect letters total on their cryptogram and still be correct.
                            The
                            frequency of the incorrect letter is irrelevant. See the example below.
                            <br /> If the cryptogram was as shown:

                            then it counts as four mistakes (even though the mistake was only in the letter E) and the
                            answer DOES NOT count. However,
                            if they put

                            It is considered correct with two letter mistakes.

                            For example if they solved the time question at the 6:46 mark, you would add 360 (from the
                            6:xx entry in the first table)
                            to 28 (from the X:46 entry in the second table) to get a bonus of 388. If they had solved it
                            in exactly 4:00 minutes, you would add 600 and 120 to get a bonus of 720.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add up all the scores and put the total on the bottom of score sheet.</li>
                        <li>You must break all ties. Indicate the tie breaker by adding .1 to the score of the team
                            ahead.
                            With multiple teams tied, you will add more. I.e. if five teams all scored 200 points, the
                            final
                            scores that you would enter on the score sheet would be 200.4, 200.3, 200.2, 200.1 and 200.
                        </li>
                        <li>To determine how to break the tie, you need to look at the correctly answered questions in
                            the
                            order from the table below. If both teams answered the same (i.e. they answered the question
                            with zero mistakes) then you go on to the next question. If one team had no mistakes and the
                            other team had one mistake, then the team with no mistakes is ahead. For example, if one
                            team
                            answered question the highest value question and another team didn't, the first
                            team will be ahead. Note that if a test is completely blank, with no evidence of work on any
                            of the
                            ciphers, it should be awarded a score of "P".

                        </li>
                        <li>If there is still a tie (typically when you have teams which answered either zero, one or
                            two
                            questions) then you will need to look at the tie breaker questions again and count the
                            number
                            of correctly answered letters. The team with the most correctly matched letters is to be
                            ahead.</li>
