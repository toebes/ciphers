                    appropriate balance of question types. It might be helpful to know that there is a <a

                    full of videos that cover various aspects of test creation, printing, score balancing, and so on.
                    While the accompanying instructional video for each question type is linked below under the
                    appropriate heading, it also contains videos regarding more holistic and overarching elements of
                    test creation.
                </p>
                <p>For all questions, it is important to carefully check the encoded text for any
                    inappropriate or potentially offensive words that may be generated by the encoding.</p>
                <p>When writing the question text, all cipher or plain decoded text should be indicated by using a

                <p>It is best practice to avoid making questions with point values that are rounded numbers (200, 350,
                    etc.); instead, use a variety of values in the ones and tens places (153, 287, etc.) in order to
                    reduce the likelihood of ties. For each question, there is a "Suggest Points" button that will offer
                    a range of values that you can use as a starting point for the point value of a question, and make
                    changes if needed to account for the difficulty. There is a helpful <a class="ytvideo"

                <p>The Atbash is one of the easiest Ciphers for students to encode or decode because the alphabet
                    is fixed. The letter <b>v</b> will always stand for the letter
                    <b>e</b> and vice-versa. There should only be one

                <p class="in">The only factor for difficulty with this
                    question is in the number of characters in the phrase. The choice of letters/words/word length has
                    no
                    impact on the difficulty. In general the question should be between 45 and 80 characters. It is only
                    slightly harder to have the students <span class="ctl">Encode</span> because it
                    isn't obvious when they have the correct answer. An <span class="ctl">Encode</span> problem is
                    also slightly harder to grade as it requires carefully checking each letter
                    instead of simply reading the answer.</p>
                <span class="ht">Points:</span>
                <p class="in">An Atbash Cipher <span class="ctl">Decode</span> should
                    be worth around 100 points
                    (approximately 1.2 points per character plus
                    2.5 points per unique character in the <span class="ctl">Plain Text</span>).
                    An Atbash Cipher <span class="ctl">Encode</span> could be worth 120-150 points
                    depending on the length of the encode string (approximately 1.2 points per character rounded to the
                    nearest 10).</p>
                <span class="ht">Question Text:</span>
                <p class="in"> The question should clearly indicate that
                    cipher has been encoded using the Atbash Cipher as well as the origin of the phrase or quote. It

                <p>The Caesar Cipher is a fairly simple cipher where once you know a single letter
                    mapping, the remainder of the problem is a simple transposition. There should be no more than one or
                    two Caesar Cipher questions on a test. The accompanying YouTube video can be found <a

                <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
                <p class="in">There are two factors which affect the
                    difficulty. First is the length of the cipher which in general should be approximately 80-90
                    characters. Having a single or two character word in the <span class="ctl">Plain Text</span> also
                    makes it easier to solve. Secondarily is the <span class="ctl">Shift</span> of the letters. Shifts
                    of 1,2,3 or 13 are the easiest because once the shift is known, it can generally be done without
                    even looking it up in a table. 13 is a special case because it operates similar to the Atbash in
                    that letters map in pairs.
                    It is only slightly harder to have the students <span class="ctl">Encode</span> because
                    it isn't obvious when they have the correct answer. An <span class="ctl">Encode</span> problem
                    is also slightly harder to grade as it requires carefully checking each letter

                    with the 120 point being associated with a Caesar with a larger shift and no short words. A
                    Caesar
                    Cipher <span class="ctl">Encode</span> should be worth 120-160 points with

                <p>These will take up the bulk of the questions. It is helpful to search for a
                    variety of quotes and phrases to use in order to pick the ones which best meet your needs. A good
                    quote will have around 20 words and about 100-120 characters (including spaces) for Aristocrats and
                    110-130
                    characters for Patristocrats. Note that the only difference between an Aristocrat and a Patristocrat
                    is whether you take the spaces out or not, so the same quotes work for both. However, you generally
                    want slightly longer phrases for the Patristocrats to give more patterns for the team to find. There

                <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
                <p class="in">There are multiple factors which
                    affect the difficulty of an Aristocrat. First and foremost is the match of the phrase to the
                    frequency of distribution of letters relative to the standard distribution of English letters:</p>

                <p class="in1">Table 1 - Frequency of English Letters</p>
                <p class="in1">Fortunately the tool will calculate the <em>Chi-Square Value</em> to give an indication
                    of
                    how close the phrase is to a standard distribution. The lower the value, the easier the phrase.
                </p>
                <p class="in1">Secondarily, the choice of words matters. A phrase using obtuse/archaic
                    language or atypical words will be more difficult than one which uses simple words. The presence of
                    single and double letter words helps to make the problem easier.</p>
                <p class="in1">Third, phrases that start with <span class="fq">it is</span>, have multiple
                    occurrences of <span class="fq">the</span> or contain the words <span class="fq">these</span>,
                    <span class="fq">there</span>, <span class="fq">little</span> or <span class="fq">people</span> tend
                    to be easier. You will also want some samples
                    which have repeated words to use for test questions providing hints. In general, it is good to
                    avoid
                    quotes which are unattributed or by anonymous to allow the author of the quote to serve as an extra
                    hint.
                </p>
                <p class="in1">When spelling and grammar errors are introduced, the problem becomes much harder.
                    Likewise, eliminating all the spaces for a Patristocrat makes it the hardest to solve.</p>
                <p class="in1">In order to make the harder problems solvable, it is good to consider using a K1 or
                    K2 alphabet to provide some additional hints. A K2 alphabet is slightly harder than a K1 alphabet,
                    but both are easier than a random alphabet.</p>
                <span id="Aristocrat_Points" class="ht">Points:</span>
                <p class="in">Aristocrats/Patristocrats have a wide range of scores, but
                    there are some general guidance to follow in setting the score. Each of the types below provide a
                    nominal range to start with. When encoding the sample text, the tool will report a <em>Chi-Square
                        Value</em>.
                    The range of the value provides a general guide to the difficulty of
                    the problem (0-20 = Easy, 20-30=Medium, 30-40=Medium Hard, 40-50=Difficult, &gt;50=Extremely
                    Difficult).
                    Taking the <em>Chi-Square Value</em> indication as a starting point, also look for short words and
                    pattern
                    words in the phrase as an adjustment to the difficulty up or down. A problem that is perceived to be
                    Easy should not be worth more than 300 points while a problem that is Difficult should not be worth
                    less than 500 points. As a rule of thumb, an Easy problem should start with a base of 200 points
                    while a Difficult one should be 750 points. For this reason it is often good to start with a number
                    of phrases to determine their difficulty and then assign them to the type of Aristocrat/Patristocrat
                    problem. It is also worth noting that with a phrase that has a high <em>Chi-Square Value</em>, while
                    it may not be ideal for an
                    Aristocrat/Patristocrat, it can easily be used for just about all the other Cipher types including
                    Baconian, Affine, Atbash, Caesar, Porta, Nihilist and Vigen&egrave;re </p>
                <p class="in1">A problem can be made less difficult in two ways. Adding a hint that reveals
                    characters makes it easier to solve. With a hint, each letter beyond 3 letters for an Aristocrat (or
                    5 letters for a Patristocrat) revealed by the hint should drop 50 points from the score. By using a
                    K1 or K2 alphabet, the score can also be dropped by 100 and 75 points respectively.</p>
                <p class="in1">Eliminating the spaces to make a phrase into a Patristocrat automatically adds 500
                    points to the difficulty and eliminates any benefit from short words.</p>
                <p class="in1">For example starting with a phrase:</p>
                <p class="ex callout small secondary ">Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no
                    reasonable man could doubt it?</p>
                <p class="in1">with a Chi-Square of 11.50, we see multiple short words (<span class="fq">it</span>,
                    <span class="fq">is</span>, <span class="fq">in</span>), and a hint of three letters
                    (<span class="fq">man</span>) this problem would be one of the easiest with a score of 200.
                    It would also make for a good timed question. By changing it to a Patristocrat, we
                    would add
                    500 to get a base score of 700. If we encode it with a K1 alphabet we drop 100 points for a
                    score of
                    600. At this range we should also be providing a hint that it starts as &ldquo;<span
                        class="fq">isthe</span>&rdquo;
                    revealing only 5 characters leaving this as a 600 point question.

                </h3>

                <p>Recovering a keyword/phrase from an Aristocrat first requires competitors to decode the Aristocrat,
                    so all of the guidance in the

                    <a href="#Aristocrat">General Aristocrat/Patristocrat guidance</a> applies. Recovering a K1 keyword
                    (keyword in the plain text) is typically very straightforward. Recovering a K2 keyword (keyword in
                    the cipher text) is also very doable once the concept is understood. Recovering a K3 keyword
                    (keyword in both the cipher text and the plain text, with the alphabets shifted) requires a
                    completely different process and merits special consideration (described below) to ensure that a
                    plaintext phrase/quote is chosen which is a suitable candidate for this type of problem.
                </p>
                <p>For K1-K3 keyword/phrase recovery problems, it is helpful to be mindful of the fact that, as is
                    typical with keywords, duplicate letters are removed when the word or phrase is used as a key, and
                    competitors are provided with blanks corresponding to the length of each word in the key phrase to
                    aid them in recovering it. For example, when they recover the characters <span
                        class="fq">TOHESAR</span> and are provided
                    with an appropriate number of blanks (2,3,5), they can work out that the key phrase here is <span
                        class="fq">TO THE
                        STARS</span>. Therefore, it is good to be especially mindful to avoid using a keyword that would
                    result as
                    indistinguishable from another when reconstructed: for example, the two different five-letter words
                    <span class="fq">DOSES</span> and <span class="fq">DOSED</span> would both result in a key of <span
                        class="fq">DOSE</span>, so either of these would be a poor keyword
                    choice as competitors would not be able to reliably recover which one was used.
                </p>
                <p>The Aristocrat encoder prefers that the plaintext be quotes or phrases that contain at least 19
                    unique characters. For K1 and K2 keyword recovery, this is not strictly required. For K3 keyword
                    recovery, 19 unique characters is an absolute minimum in selecting an appropriate phrase, as the
                    less of the alphabet is used, the more difficult the problem becomes as it results in a higher
                    number of unknown mappings. Letter frequencies in the plaintext still need to be distributed enough
                    to make it solvable (i.e., if many letters are only used once, this creates its own difficulty
                    factor for solving the Aristocrat before beginning the recovery process). A plaintext with 22 or 23
                    unique characters is more reliably solvable for K3 keyword recovery than one with fewer and is the
                    easiest way to make sure
                    that the problem isn't inadvertently too difficult without having to get into the nuts and bolts of
                    solving these as described in the next paragraph. It is also recommended to keep the Offset at 1, 2,
                    or 3.</p>
                <p>The process of K3 keyword recovery is described in detail here:

                </ul>To put it simply, to recover a K3 keyword, competitors must first reconstruct a single,
                26-character alphabet (which is the reason more unknown mappings make this more difficult). If that is
                straightforward, the difficulty is reduced; if it requires them to interleave smaller chains, the
                difficulty is increased. After that, they must perform the decimation step. If the decimation factor is
                odd, the procedure should be somewhat straightforward; if the decimation factor is even, this requires
                them to use alternating interleave spacing which makes the decimation more complicated.</p>

                <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
                <p class="in">
                    K1 and K2 keyword recovery are significantly easier than K3 keyword recovery. Difficulty for all
                    types is somewhat increased when the keyword contains duplicate letters. For K3 keyword recovery,
                    difficulty is also increased when fewer unique characters are used in the plaintext; when the
                    keyword draws from low-frequency letters; when the reconstruction results in two or more short loops
                    than in one long loop; and when the decimation step requires alternating interleave spacing.

                <p>The Nihilist cipher is a substitution cipher. It uses two keywords, the polybius key and normal
                    keyword, to encode the plaintext.
                    The polybius key is used to generate a Polybius Square, which is a 5x5 table that maps every letter
                    to a number based on its row and column.
                    The normal keyword is used to encode the plaintext, applying each
                    letter in the keyword in sequence in just the same way that the Vigenère cipher
                    works. There should be no more than 2 Nihilist decryption problems on a test.</p>
                <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
                <p class="in">In general, more room for error makes it more difficult to get the right
                    answer. There is more room for error when the key length and the block size are different. A block
                    size of 0 may provide clues to the encoded words, so reduces difficulty.
                    A longer polybius key or one with duplicate letters makes it more difficult because there is
                    increased chance of
                    creating the polybius square incorrectly. A longer encoding key also means there is more work to do.
                    needed. Putting 'Z' in the polybius key means it will not have a numeric value of 55, which is
                    a common assumption, so this slightly increases the difficulty.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>The Nihilist cipher is a substitution cipher. It uses two keywords to encode the plaintext.
                    The first is used to construction a Polybius Square which is used to map all of the
                    letters to numbers. The second keyword is used to encode the plaintext, applying each
                    letter in the keyword in sequence in just the same way that the Vigenère cipher
                    works. Doing cryptanalysis, some of the mapping of plain text to cipher text is given and the
                    polybius square and keyword need to be derived from that mapping. This is an iterative process that
                    substantially increases the difficulty.</p>
                <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
                <p class="in">In addition to the <a href="#Nihilist">notes above</a>, In addition to the notes above,
                    cryptanalysis makes Nihilist ciphers significantly more difficult due to the iteration and deduction
                    required to solve it. As a result, these will be some of the most time-consuming problems on the
                    test, and care should be taken to avoid making them too difficult. One factor for difficulty is the
                    Block Size. A Block Size of 0 will make these easier to solve, while a Block Size that is nonzero
                    and different from the keyword length will make these more difficult. Another factor for difficulty
                    is the choice of crib. A longer crib makes the problem easier than a shorter crib, but note that too
                    many duplicate letters within the crib will reduce the information that solvers have given to them.
                    A third factor for difficulty is the relationship between the Keyword, the Polybius Key, and the
                    Polybius table. If, after the Polybius table is constructed, the keyword draws primarily from the
                    center values in the table, the problem will be more difficult. It is helpful to solvers if the
                    keyword contains letters from a wider variety of locations in the Polybius table - both low values
                    (letters which are also contained in the Polybius key) and high values (letters from the last row in
                    the Polybius table), to help them analyze patterns in the cipher values. Lastly, the AutoSolver
                    provides guidance on whether it is able to recover the keyword given the choice of keyword and crib
                    provided, which can help guide the construction of these problems. Unlike most other kinds of
                    ciphers, it is much easier to inadvertently make these unsolvable in competition time than it
                    is to make them too easy, so don't hesitate
                    to set the Block Size
                    at 0 and to have a crib substantially longer than required by the rules (for example, the same
                    length or longer than the keyword).</p>

                <p>With the <span class="ctl">Words</span> Baconian cipher which is

                    Obviously the default with the tool of <span class="fq">ABABAB</span>&hellip; is the easiest and it
                    is
                    not recommended to use
                    this for the test. There are lots of patterns which work (first half of the alphabet is <span
                        class="fq">A</span>,
                    second
                    half is <span class="fq">B</span>). But there are some that don't work such as <span
                        class="fq">BABABA</span>&hellip;
                    which eliminates all
                    vowels from being an <span class="fq">A</span>. Fortunately the tool tells you when the pattern
                    picked
                    doesn't have any
                    words to match. Note that with the <span class="ctl">Words</span> Baconian, a crib and crib location
                    should both be provided.
                    The tool will highlight the letters that are given with the crib, helping the test writer to
                    evaluate how much information is available to the competitors. The accompanying YouTube video can be

                    ciphers it is possible to have multiple letters stand for A and B, but it is
                    recommended to use symbols (which can be pasted into the fields). Having a variety of symbols which
                    have potential overlap can make it harder. For example on the <a
                        href="https://toebes.com/codebusters/Samples/Code%20Busters%202018%20Test%20State.pdf">2018
                        North Carolina State test</a>, the key to the solution was that 'A' was represented by any arrow
                    pointing
                    down (e.g. <img class="imgscale" src="BaconianA.png" alt="Baconian A Image" />) and 'B' was
                    represented by any
                    arrow
                    pointing up
                    (e.g. <img class="imgscale" src="BaconianB.png" alt="Baconian B Image" />); so that the students had
                    to
                    figure out whether the direction of the arrow or the line was what indicated the difference. As in
                    this example, it is best practice for there to be some way for competitors to deduce at least two
                    different groups of symbols they can assign to A and B: while they may have to test a couple of
                    different hypotheses, it should not be completely random. There are accompanying YouTube videos for

                <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
                <p class="in">There are three factors which affect the
                    difficulty. First is the choice of symbols to represent the Baconian. The harder to distinguish, the
                    more points the question should be worth. Second is how much of a clue is provided. Lastly is
                    the size of the grouping. By picking a <span class="ctl">Line Width</span> which
                    is not a multiple of 5, it ensures that the students have to carefully manage wrapping a group of 5
                    across
                    a line boundary.</p>

                    complex pattern and a couple letters of clues would be worth 400. The basic calculation is roughly 6
                    points per letter, plus various bonuses based on the type of Baconian, the patterns it uses, and the
                    other factors for difficulty mentioned above.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>The Cryptarithm is a cipher that maps each digit 0-9 to a different letter and provides an entire
                    mathematical equation where the digits are substituted with the corresponding letters. Competitors
                    can use mathematical deduction to determine which digit each letter corresponds to, and then they
                    are asked to decode a phrase where the digits are provided and they are to use the information
                    they've gathered to decode it. There is an accompanying <a class="ytvideo"
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMrvnDl_APk">YouTube video</a> that covers how to put a
                    cryptarithm into a test.</p>
                <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
                <p class="in">A primary factor for difficulty in these is the choice of math problem. Competitors will
                    be accustomed to working with basic addition or subtraction problems, so providing any type of
                    multiplication or long division problem will make it significantly more difficult. These problems
                    also become more difficult when more than one value can map to a given letter. One way to make sure
                    competitors have a place to approach these problems is through providing an addition or subtraction
                    problem where the largest value has more digits than the other values (as demonstrated in the sample
                    question below), so they can deduce that it is
                    likely to begin with a 1. Note that if you use the tool to generate the cryptarithm, it will
                    estimate the difficulty of the cipher on a scale of 1-5. Aside from the math problem itself,
                    competitors typically work it alongside the
                    "phrase to decode," so this phrase also affects the difficulty: longer phrases become somewhat
                    easier, as competitors can begin deducing letter frequencies and patterns as they do for Aristocrat
                    ciphers, and short phrases containing short, uncommon words are more difficult.</p>

                    (usually bumped up) using the factors for difficulty above.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>The Complete Columnar Cipher is a transposition cipher. Plain text is written across a table with a
                    pre-defined number of columns. The column order is mixed up by providing a
                    <strong>column ordering</strong>
                    string. For example, if the column count is 7 and the column order string is
                    <span class="fq">SCIENCE</span>, the column order will be rearranged to be in the order:
                    <span class="fq">2</span>,
                    <span class="fq">6</span>,
                    <span class="fq">4</span>,
                    <span class="fq">7</span>,
                    <span class="fq">3</span>,
                    <span class="fq">5</span>,
                    <span class="fq">1</span>.
                    The column order string gets alphabetically sorted to <span class="fq">CCEEINS</span> and we find
                    the first
                    character <span class="fq">C</span> in position 2 of the column sorting string, the
                    next <span class="fq">C</span> in
                    position 6 of the column sorting string, the first <span class="fq">E</span> in position 4, etc.
                    The columns of the plain text table are rearranged using this order and the cipher text is
                    generated by reading down each column, starting with the first column on the left and working
                    across.
                </p>
                <p class="ex callout small secondary"><span class="fq">Note</span>: Single letter and/or number
                    characters can be used in the column order string. Numbers 0-9 and uppercase characters A-Z
                    are used and lower case letters are automatically converted to upper case.
                    The order is determined by sorting the characters using
                    their ASCII value (numbers come before letters). Duplicate characters are taken in
                    order, left to right. For greater than 10 columns, double digit numbers are not honored.
                    However, letters can be used to avoid duplicate values in the column order string, although
                    it is not necessary.
                </p>
                <p>To put these columns back in the correct order (mentally renumbering them 1-7), take them in numeric
                    order.
                    I.e., the column labeled <span class="fq">1</span> is in the <strong>seventh</strong> position,
                    the column labeled <span class="fq">2</span> is in the <strong>first</strong> position,
                    the column labeled <span class="fq">3</span> is in the <strong>fifth</strong> position, etc.
                    So the transposed table would be rewritten with column ordering:
                    <span class="fq">7</span>,
                    <span class="fq">1</span>,
                    <span class="fq">5</span>,
                    <span class="fq">3</span>,
                    <span class="fq">6</span>,
                    <span class="fq">2</span>,
                    <span class="fq">4</span> to reveal the original plain text in a seven column table.
                </p>

                <p class="in">For a 2x2 matrix we can be explicit.
                    Since it is very likely that we will want either the 2nd or 3rd letter to be a vowel,
                    the more useful advice would be that one or both of the 2nd and 3rd letters should be vowels,
                    while both the first and last letters come from the set of odd letters listed above.
                    This would guarantee that the determinant is odd,
                    and then we only need to check to make sure it isn't 0 (mod 13),
                    which means we would succeed with probability 12/13.</p>
                <p>
                    For a 3x3 matrix it isn't as easy, but if we ask for about half the letters to be odd (same set as
                    before),
                    then there is a good chance that the determinant will be odd. In fact, assuming random placement of

                    2. If we are lucky, we may get by with 4 odd letters; with only 3 odd letters we need to be

                    and for any other number of odd letters, it is simply impossible.

                <p class="in">
                    The difficulty can depend on how long the crib is (longer is easier) and where the crib
                    text is placed (it may reveal more morse mappings). The difficulty is also related to the
                    letters that are chosen for the keyword -- the difficulty
                    increases when the keyword draws letters from throughout the alphabet, when it draws
                    from the end of the alphabet, when the keyword is very long, and when there are duplicate letters in
                    the keyword.
                    Another factor for difficulty is how frequently the letters that the crib maps to are
                    used throughout the rest of the cipher.

                    the problem is much easier than with the default <span class="ctl">Block Size</span> of 0
                    that keeps the original spacing. Setting the <span class="ctl">Block Size</span> to a

                    many other keyword ciphers, this one actually becomes marginally easier if there are duplicate
                    letters in the key, as it reduces the number of rows and columns that competitors have to consult.

                <p>Pick a phrase to encode. As a rule of thumb for a 2x2 matrix, every pair of letters is
                    worth 16 points. Ideally you want an odd length string to force them to use a padding Z.
                    For a 3x3 matrix, every group of three letters is worth 21
                    points. It is important to pick a phrase which is not a multiple of 3 characters long so that
                    they must add the appropriate number of padding characters.</p>
                <p>Pick an encoding key. For a 2x2 it is 4 characters long and for a 3x3 it is 9 characters
                    long. This is probably the hardest part to making the test as the matrix has to be invertible (<a

                    be slightly harder. If you are generating tests for multiple regions, pick numbers that are near

                </h2>
                <p>The Knights Templar Cipher is similar to the PigPen/Masonic Cipher and is generally easy for students
                    to decode because the alphabet
                    is fixed. The letter <b>N</b> will always be represented by an X. There can be a couple of
                    Knights Templar Cipher questions on a test. There is an accompanying YouTube video for creating a
                    Knights Templar
                    cipher that can be found <a class="ytvideo"

                <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
                <p class="in">The only factor for difficulty with this
                    question is in the number of characters in the phrase. The choice of letters/words/word length has
                    no impact on the difficulty. In general the question should be approximately 40-50 characters.</p>
                <span class="ht">Points:</span>
                <p class="in">A Knights Templar Cipher <span class="ctl">Decode</span> should
                    be worth 60-80 points (approximately 1 point per character in the <span class="ctl">Plain
                        Text</span> plus 1.5 points for each unique character).
                </p>
                <span class="ht">Question Text:</span>
                <p class="in"> The question should clearly indicate that
                    cipher has been encoded using the Knights Templar Cipher as well as the origin of the phrase or
                    quote. It
                    should not include a hint. For example:</p>
                <p class="ex callout small secondary ">Solve this quote from <em>&lt;person&gt;</em> which
                    has been encoded with the Knights Templar Cipher.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>The Tap Code is is a simple cipher to decode because the mapping is
                    is fixed. A single dot followed by a single dot will always stand for the letter <b>a</b>.
                    What makes it slightly more challenging is that the students need to
                    memorize the table or just know how to recreate it on the test.
                    There should be one or two Tap Code Cipher questions on a test. The accompanying instructional
                    YouTube video can be found <a class="ytvideo"

                <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
                <p class="in">The two factors for difficulty with this
                    question is in the number of characters in the phrase and how far down in the alphabet
                    the letters are. The further in the alphabet, the more characters that they have to count.</p>
                <span class="ht">Points:</span>
                <p class="in">A Tap Code Cipher should be worth 55-75 points. This works out to about 1.5 points per
                    letter or one point for every 3 or 4 taps generated.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>The rail fence cipher encodes messages by 'zig-zagging' the letters along 2 to 6 'rails'. The cipher
                    can
                    be decoded by brute force; trial and error; or procedurally by applying some simple math and
                    understanding spacing of characters in the rail patterns.

                <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
                <p class="in">The difficulty gets slightly higher with more rails because it requires more diligence
                    when solving. It becomes slightly more difficult when there is an offset, and significantly moreso
                    when the offset is unknown because of the additional time investment required for trial and error.
